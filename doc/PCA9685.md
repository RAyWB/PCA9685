## Class PCA9685

Encapsulates all communication with PCA9685 chipset

### Constructors

#### PCA9685()

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- default I2C address (A0 - A5 connected to ground)  
- default driver mode of direct motor drive
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- default driver mode of direct motor drive
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr, uint8_t driveMode);

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- the specified driver mode
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr, uint8_t driveMode, float frequency);

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- the specified driver mode
- the specified frequency (chipset limitation around 40Hz - 1000Hz)  

### Methods

#### Led& getLed(uint8_t pin)

Gets a single Led in order to let you modify or read it.

#### float getFrequency() const

Gets the frequency at which the chip's PWM cycle is operating.

#### void setFrequency(float frequency)

Sets the frequency at which the chip's PWM cycle should be operating.

**Call setup() for changes to take effect**

#### uint8_t getPreScale() const

Gets the pre scale value, which indicates the frequency at which the chip's PWM cycle is operating.  
(Chip's internal implementation)

PreScale = (Clock Speed / (4096 * frequency)) - 1

#### void setPreScale(uint8_t preScale);

Sets the pre scale value, which indicates the frequency at which the chip's PWM cycle is operating.  
(Chip's internal implementation)

PreScale = (Clock Speed / (4096 * frequency)) - 1

**Call setup() for changes to take effect**

#### uint8_t getDriveMode() const

Gets the driver mode of the chip. Please see documentation of defines below for schematic explaination.

#### void setDriveMode(uint8_t driveMode);

Sets the driver mode of the chip. Please see documentation of defines below for schematic explaination.

**Call setup() for changes to take effect**

#### void setup() const

Initializes the PCA9685 chip with your settings for frequency and driver mode. This method can be called everytime you want to change your setup. No need to restart the chip for frequency or driver mode changes.

#### void writeAllLeds() const

Writes all output values of all Leds to all Led pins on PCA9685





## Class PCA9685::Led

Encapsulates a single Led pin on PCA9685 chipset

### Constructors

#### Led(uint8_t idx, PCA9685* parent)

Initializes a new Led pin with the specified index (0 = LED0, 15 = LED15) and a default value of 0 (full off)  
Parent is a pointer to the parent PCA9685 chip. It is used to do operations on the pinn.

### Methods

#### void write() const

Writes the value of this object to the Led pin on PCA9685

#### uint16_t getValue()

Returns the value of this object  

#### void setValue(uint16_t value)

Changes the value of this object.  
**Does not automatically update the value on the chip as well! Use setValueAndWrite(uint16_t) instead**

#### void setValueAndWrite(uint16_t value)

Changes the value of this object and updates the Led pin on PCA9685

#### void fullOn()

Sets the value of this object to be fully on

#### void fullOnAndWrite();

Sets the value of this object to be fully on and updates the Led pin on PCA9685

#### void fullOff()

Sets the value of this object to be fully off

#### void fullOffAndWrite()

Sets the value of this object to be fully off and updates the Led pin on PCA9685
