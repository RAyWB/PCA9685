## Class PCA9685

Encapsulates all communication with PCA9685 chipset

### Constructors

#### PCA9685()

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- default I2C address (A0 - A5 connected to ground)  
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  
- default driver mode of direct motor drive

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  
- default driver mode of direct motor drive

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr, float frequency)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- the specified frequency (chipset limitation around 40Hz - 1000Hz)  
- default driver mode of direct motor drive

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr, float frequency, uint8_t driveMode)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- the specified frequency (chipset limitation around 40Hz - 1000Hz)  
- the specified driver mode

#### PCA9685(uint8_t i2cSlaveAdr, uint8_t driveMode)

Initializes a new instance of the PCA9685 chip with  
- the specified I2C address (only the values of pulled up A0 - A5 pins are needed)  
- default frequency of ~200Hz (PRE_SCALE at 1Eh at 25MHz internal clock)  
- the specified driver mode

### Methods

#### Led& getLed(uint8_t pin)

Gets a single Led in order to let you modify or read it.

#### void setup() const

Initializes the PCA9685 chip with your settings for frequency and driver mode

#### void readAllLeds()

Reads all output values from PCA9685 and updates all Led objects

#### void writeAllLeds() const

Writes all output values of all Leds to PCA9685





## Class PCA9685::Led

Encapsulates a single Led pin on PCA9685 chipset

### Constructors

#### Led(uint8_t idx, PCA9685* parent)

Initializes a new Led pin with the specified index (0 = LED0, 15 = LED15) and a default value of 0 (full off)  
Parent is a pointer to the parent PCA9685 chip. It is used to do operations on the pinn.

### Methods

#### void read()

Reads the value of this Led pin from PCA9685 and updates the value of this object

#### void write() const

Writes the value of this object to the Led pin on PCA9685

#### uint16_t getValue()

Returns the value of this object  

#### void setValue(uint16_t value)

Changes the value of this object.  
**Does not automatically update the value on the chip as well! write() needs to be called**

#### void fullOn()

Sets the value of this object to be fully on

#### void fullOff()

Sets the value of this object to be fully off
